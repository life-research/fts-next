# FHIR Transfer Services Usage Guide

Welcome to the FHIR Transfer Services user guide! This guide will help you get started with running
the FHIR Transfer Services components: Clinical Domain Transfer Agent (CDA), Research Domain
Transfer Agent (RDA), and Trust Center Agent (TCA). As the three components are intended to be run
in different "domains" of a data integration center, running and configuring each component will be
described in respective documents.
